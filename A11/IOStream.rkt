#lang lazy

;; This module implements input and output streams as lazy lists

;; (outstream S) -- send S to output, one element per line
;; instream -- each element of instream is read from input

;; Example
;;
;; (outstream (map add1 instream))
;;
;; outputs 1 greater than every number in input

  (define in (read))
