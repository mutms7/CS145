if f is O(g) and g is in O(h), then f is in O(h)

f is O(g) implies there exists an x1 for all c1>0 for which x>=x1 means f(x) < c1*g(x)
g is O(h) implies there exists an x2 for all c2>0 for which x>=x2 means g(x) < c2*h(x)

Pick c = c1*c2 and x0 = max(x1, x2)
Now for x >= x0,
f(n) < c1*g(x) < c1*c2*h(x) = c*h(x)
